# GameJoy
GameJoy is a Game Boy emulator being developed in C++.  
To test the emulator, I've been using the individual test ROMs created by Blargg. They can be downloaded from https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/ under cpu_instrs.zip, inside the 'individual' folder. Currently, all tests apart from 02 are passed.

So far, it supports Tetris, with some graphical errors.

The emulator currently runs as fast as possible, so I need to cap its speed.

360 controllers are supported, just make sure you plug it in before starting the emulator!
