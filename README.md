# GameJoy
GameJoy is a Game Boy emulator being developed in C++.  
The test ROM was created by Blargg, and can be downloaded from https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/.

Currently I am implementing all the opcodes for the CPU. After this is completed, I can move onto implementing the graphics and input, with further work on the CPU if required.
