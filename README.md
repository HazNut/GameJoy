# GameJoy
GameJoy is a Game Boy emulator being developed in C++.  
The emulator is being tested using test ROMs created by Blargg. They can be downloaded from https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/ under cpu_instrs.zip. Currently, test ROMs 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10 and 11 are passed.

I have implemented the majority of opcodes on the CPU, and am currently working on the graphics and other features.

Note: The project makes use of SDL2. The files need to be included under gb/SDL.

Controls: DPAD is WASD, B/A is O/P, Select/Start is K/L.
